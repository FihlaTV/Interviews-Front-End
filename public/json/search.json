            "description":"Hi and welcome to our cozy Echo Park pad. I grew up with a Westie, and do not currently have any pets. My husband (Brian) and I have always wanted to get a dog, but can't seem to keep a consistent schedule. So, the next best thing is watching other people's dogs! We love all sizes, sexes, and breeds. Our home is pet friendly, our porch is always locked and closed, along with the entire property being gated. Your pet can't escape!\r\n\r\nI exercise daily, so I'd love to take your pup on a walk or run with me. We'd spend lots of time outside, but an equal amount of time cuddling inside. Echo Park Lake is less than a 10 minute walk from me, and I go to Silverlake Reservoir regularly, too. If he\/she is here for the weekend, we usually take a road trip to go hiking. Your dog will always have an adventure at my house!\r\n\r\nI can't believe I'm admitting this, but I tend to talk and sing to dogs just like they're people. Maybe cause I'm a therapist, maybe cause I'm a little crazy! I just want your dog to feel at home. :) We look forward to hosting your adorable pets!",

And play with toys.  I work from home, so am around for whatever your pooch needs.  Dog park a couple blocks away.\r\n\r\nMeet and greets are encouraged and there is a small amount of paper work that needs to be filled out so Poco and I know all of your child's needs.\r\n\r\nIf the final stay day goes over the 24 hours we will want to discuss adding a day rate.\r\n\r\nIt is appreciated when scheduled times are kept firm.\r\n\r\nThe holiday rate is 1.5 times the normal rate.
